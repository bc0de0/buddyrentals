## Branching and Workflow Guidelines

- **Do NOT commit directly to the `main` branch.**
- All feature development and fixes should be done on individual branches named by your username or feature, e.g., `feature/login-auth` or `kunal/geocode-integration`.
- When your branch is ready, open a Pull Request (PR) targeting the `main` branch.
- PRs must be reviewed and approved by a maintainer before merging.
- Only maintainers have permission to merge PRs into `main`.
- Ensure your commits are clear and descriptive.

- Write unit tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Document your code as needed.
